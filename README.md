# synthetic-noise
These is code to add synthetic noise to an AVIRIS or AVIRIS NG synthetic image based on NEdL

# Inputs
the inputs for this file are a synthetic AVIRIS or AVIRIS NG images and NEdL coefficients. The NEdL coefficients were originally created by Phill Dennison. Contact him or Alana Ayasse for the files. 

# Outputs
The output for this code is an image with synthetic noise added in, there is also some code in to produce an image of the noise but I may have deleted it.

# variations
The code can be modified farily easily to change what the noise is based on. It could be changed to have random gaussian noise, or anything else. Additionaly this could be used on a non-AVIRIS image.
